		VallSrfLanded = Nothing to report here.

		TyloFlyingLow = Surprisingly, you discover no traces of atmosphere.
		TyloSrfLanded = There is no detectable atmospheric pressure here. Fascinating!

		BopFlyingLow = It's a giant space rock. What did you expect to find?
		BopSrfLanded = Still nothing. Definitely just a space rock.

		PolFlyingLow = Nothing to report here.
		PolSrfLanded = No atmospheric pressure is detectable on Pol.

		EelooSrfLanded = Still nothing. Definitely just a space rock.
		EelooFlyingLow = The instrument can't register any pressure here.
		
		Space = The instrument reads zero. It's as if it were in a vacuum!

		DunaSrfLanded = The atmosphere of Duna is too thin and too cold for water to be stable as a liquid.
		
		MohoSrfLanded = Probe has found evidence of ice.

		EveSrfLanded = Eve has no water on the surface, because it evaporates in the heat of the crushing atmosphere.
		
		SpaceHigh = 0% water vapor. Nothing to report here.
